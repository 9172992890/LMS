This project involves the development of a robust Library Management System (LMS) using modern technology stack components. Utilizing Spring Boot as the framework and MySQL as the database management system, the system ensures efficient data handling and storage. Spring Boot MVC is employed to create RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication and interaction with the system's functionalities. This setup not only enhances performance and scalability but also facilitates easy integration with other systems and future expansions. The LMS aims to streamline library operations, including catalog management, user authentication, borrowing and returning of books, and administrative tasks, all while providing a user-friendly experience.
